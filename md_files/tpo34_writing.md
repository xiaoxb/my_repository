  It is universally acknowledged that various technologies such as cell phone,online games,and social networking Web sites play a more important role on in education than before.In my opinion,I disagree with the statement that nowadays it is more difficult to educate children than in the past because children can take advantage of those high-technologies to enhance their academic performance.  

  First and foremost,compared to in the past,at present the cell phone can is enabled to create a good positive effect on child's study.Thanks to various advanced software on the cell phone,student find it not difficult to grasp the most scientific learning methods.For instance,in the past,children learned the new words by text book without audio format,which led to the result that children could's not speak the words with correct pronunciations.Children tended to have a false pronunciations or even mute English;whild today,children can are allowed to study those new words by the cell phone and they can imitate the native speaker's voice through the audio format in the cell phone.As a result,more and more children can speak English fluently.Form this fact,we can learn that the cell phone makes educating much easier and comprehensive than before.  
    
  Furthermore,teaching children is easier than before by the way of the obvious benefit that playing online games which can cultivate children's ablitity of cooperation cannot be ignored.Through competing and interacting with others in the online games which can be called as a miniature of society,children can experience a sense of cooperation and responsibility intangibly.For example,due to the limitation of real situation,children are assigned to different tasks.Only when they cooperate well,can they get final success.From this experience,children can have a sense of teamwork,which cannot be learned from class.This example tells us Obviously,in the modern society,children have kinds of chances to practice their cooperation ability as result of internet,which is better for their education.  
  In a nutshell,I strongly disagree with the statement.With the advanced technology like cell phone,online games,and social networking Web site it can facilitate children's education and help them be successful easier more easily in their future.  

  In conclusion,it is my opinion that the most important lesson people should learn can only be taught through oneself rather than family.  

  No reasonable man can deny the fact that the costs of raising a children especially in metropolitan areas have skyrocketed in the past few decades.  

  financial burden  

  It is also conductive to the development of cognition ability.  

  avoiding excessive spending is essential for maintaining a harmonious family relationship.  

  Nowasays   accounts for the majority of population in any society.  

  Indeed,the fees demanded by most kindergartens have to be consistent with the level of average income in the area;otherwise ,families will not afford sending their child to the institution.

  段落开头:First of all;Moreover;What is more;    

  The most widely accepted theory  ...   

  interactions with external world.  

  The existence of ultimate logical thinking skill which is a necessary ability for any promising young man and woman is indispensable from the factors mentioned above.  

  plenty of opportunities 

  In conclusion,it is my opinion that parents should take their children to a local children-care center given the evalution of pros and cons discussed above.  

  In recent years ,more and more parents and educators have begun to accept the philosophy that ...   
  I am inclined to the option of allocating most of the budget concerned with student activaties to arts.  

  The activities not only can benefit students to form a positive attitude toward life,funding the art programs can also contribute to the development of school in the term.  

  First of all,participating in high quality and resourceful arts helps students to become well-rounded.  
  
  In the process of completing an art project.  
   
  be aware of the fact that..As a result,the student will be aware of the fact that quality of perserverance is the key of mastering a skill regardless of fine arts,music or dance.  

  What is more,making investment in arts **is conducive to** the school's prosperity and **sustainable development** in the long term.  

  When a school encounters financial difficulty,it should focus on how to increase its revenue rather than reducing expenditure.**acquire influence**  **endowment  捐助**   

  In conclusion,**taken the benefits discussed above into consideration**,I support the idea that the school should allocate most of its capital to arts.  

  Being a high school teacher if one of the most demanding jobs in the world.  

  Not only does the ability enable students to **distinguish themselves in future**,it is also a good opportunity for students to form their own outlook on life..  

  In the era of information exposition.Their students will not simply follow orders but command their own destinies.  

  The discussion about whether there is a strong correlation between the development of society and the level of beneficence has lasted fot years.  

  There is a convincing connection between the quality of teaching facilities and student's grades.  
  Teachers will be able to plan and develop intriguing teaching methods if they can take advantage of the best teaching facilities.  

  Admittedly,universities may be able to attract more students if they hire popular teachers instead of spending money on facilities.However,I always insist on quality as opposed to quantity.The short -term benefit of hiring star teachers will not weaken my belief that it is more important to buy high quality facilities in recognition of long-term considerations.   

  Not only can the space exploitation expand human knowledge to an unprecedented level,it has the potential to create real eternal economic prosperity.  

  In conclusion,I am thrilled by the prospect of space travel and travel exploration..  

  People who cannot accept the criticism from others will not be successful at working in a group.  

  Persistence is a vital factor for success-stick to the goal and strong minded.  

  Criticism strengthen us.   

  An effective leader should try to make others feel that they are part of the decision making process.   
  
  A decision,which has taken the opinions of various sides into consideration, can be more sensible and effective.  

  **A distinctive illustration is that** parents may some day grow too old to make decisions for their kids.If their kids get used to listening to their parents and don't have the the ability to make their own,the consequences may be devastating.
