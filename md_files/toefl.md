   Government may introduce affordable and comfortable public transportations --people will give up private transportations without hesitations---thus we can expect better air quality.

   第二句：表明观点。
   最直接的就是：你的观点（赞成或者反对）+复述题目观点。

   或者先让步接纳对方的观点有一定的道理，然后再阐述自己的观点。

   第三句：    
   开头段示例：Making decisions is often considered as one of the most challenging tasks for young people, especially in critical situations. Although parents used to have a strong influence on their child's decision-making process, I believe that young people are more capable of making independent decisions in today's socioeconomic environment. (让步表明观点) Nowadays not only are youngsters able to conduct cost and benefit analysis of their ideas according to market economy principles, (原因1) the open social environment also encourages them to make decisionson their own. (原因2)  
   ####开头段常见表达语料库：  
   1. 赞成某一观点：  
   句型：I believe (or “agree with the idea”)[固定搭配] + that宾语从句 + 原题观点  
   I agree with the opinion that people should always express their real thoughts notwithstanding the opposite views held by others.  
   句型：...concurs with my belief that...  
   The statement that people should voice their opinions freely concurs with my belief that we should always express our true thoughts regardless of external pressures.  
   句型：I disagree with the view that  
   I disagree with the view that investing in employees' work skills is the most important consideration for a company to succeed.  If the employee leaves the company shortly after he or she has received the employment training, then the investment is actually a waste of resources. Moreover, there are many other factors that are at least equally important for a company to take into account when it considers making an investment in its employees.  
  
   In my view, there are several measures can be adopted to encounter the air pollution problem that is as effective as raising the fuel price.  

   In my opinion, government should assume the responsibility of protecting wild animals and natural environment without hesitation. The proper protection of animals and wilderness requires significant amounts of funding and other resources so it would be unrealistic for this area to be managed by private sector. Plus, government has a duty to protect our planet's ecological system for the benefit of our children.  

   In my view, government should invest more resources in early education. I believe this because children are the cornerstone of our society. A country can never prosper for long without its children being fully prepared. Many parents are busy with their jobs in the period of economic depression which implies that they don't have as much time for looking after their children. Government intervention would be a good solution to this problem.  

   It is my opinion that students are far less interested in politics than twenty years ago. In the past decade, an increasing number of students have not been concerned with public affairs neither at the domestic level nor the international level. They are busy with many other activities such as schools, social entertainments and sports. Nevertheless, I think students should have the freedom to decide how actively they will participate in politics.  

   My position is that raising fuel price is definitely not the best way to control the air pollution problem.  

   Although many young dreamers are adamant with their often unrealistic ideals, I prefer to pursue goals that engender actual results.  

   In spite of the obvious benefits of allocating the workloads evenly over the typical five working days, I prefer to work three-day a week even at the expense of fatigue.
