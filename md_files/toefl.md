3. Save the cost of living.-spend money on other aspects of life such as education-improve future standard of living.  

   Inexpensive places in my home country are usually outside downtown - less traffic and noise-create privacy and serenity in my neighborhood.
      
   Government has limited amount of capital-some individuals use Internet much more than others-It is unfair to subsidy the former group for people who require less Internet service.
      
   Internet is not as important as other infrastructure services — water, electricity and transportation are critical to our lives — without Internet our lives could still continue — the cost of providing free Internet is too much.

   Express your opinion freely -marking sure no misunderstanding--build up the trust--win the respect from others
   
   Children are able to access latest information that are widely available on the Internet -they can learn the knowledge and skills that are unfamiliar to their parents  
   Parents need to learn from their kids to catch up with their children and maintain a healthy relationship with them.

   Modern society is very demanding in terms of advanced and latest technology skills --youth enables children to have a better memory ability and study more efficiently--parents need to learn from children to fit into the society.

   The main function of teacher is to help students learn knowledge--students nowadays can master knowledge by themselves -teacher's role in education has become minimal.

   Someone's success is often judged his income-the average income of teacher is unsatisfactory compared to other professionals-teacher's reputation is therefore tarnished.

   Government may introduce affordable and comfortable public transportations --people will give up private transportations without hesitations---thus we can expect better air quality.

   Govenment can introduce a variety of new energy sources-the "new energy"can power our daily activities with minimal carbon dioxide emission --air pollution can also be controlled.

##开头段写法：
开头段的内容满足两点：
1. 清晰，有力的表明你的观点。
2. 简洁的概述支持你观点的理由。  
第一句：背景句写作。
   eg:Making decisions is often considered as one of the most challenging tasks for young people,especially in critical occasions.  
第二句：表明观点。
最直接的就是：你的观点（赞成或者反对）+复述题目观点。
   eg:I believe that young people are more capatable of making independent decisions in today's socioeconomic environment.   
或者先让步接纳对方的观点有一定的道理，然后再阐述自己的观点。   
   eg:Although parents uesd to have a strong influence on their child's decision-making process,I believe that young people are more capable to make independent decision  in today's socioeconomic environment.  
   Although there are many advantages to living in the city,I prefer life in a small town.  
   As daunting as it looks at first sight,constructing new housing does present many benefits.     
第三句：    
开头段示例：  
    Making decisions is often considered as one of the most challenging tasks for young people, especially in critical situations. Although parents used to have a strong influence on their child's decision-making process, I believe that young people are more capable of making independent decisions in today's socioeconomic environment. (让步表明观点) Nowadays not only are youngsters able to conduct cost and benefit analysis of their ideas according to market economy principles, (原因1) the open social environment also encourages them to make  their own decisions. (原因2)  

##开头段常见表达语料库：  
句型：I believe (or “agree with the idea”)[固定搭配] + that宾语从句 + 原题观点  
   I agree with the opinion that people should always express their real thoughts notwithstanding the opposite views held by others.  
句型：...concurs with my belief that...  
   The statement that people should voice their opinions freely concurs with my belief that we should always express our true thoughts regardless of external pressures.  
句型：I disagree with the view that  
   I disagree with the view that investing in employees' work skills is the most important consideration for a company to succeed.  If the employee leaves the company shortly after he or she has received the employment training, then the investment is actually a waste of resources. Moreover, there are many other factors that are at least equally important for a company to take into account when it considers making an investment in its employees.  
  
   In my view, there are several measures can be adopted to encounter the air pollution problem that is as effective as raising the fuel price.  

   In my opinion, government should assume the responsibility of protecting wild animals and natural environment without hesitation. The proper protection of animals and wilderness requires significant amounts of funding and other resources so it would be unrealistic for this area to be managed by private sector. Plus, government has a duty to protect our planet's ecological system for the benefit of our children.  

   In my view, government should invest more resources in early education. I believe this because children are the cornerstone of our society. A country can never prosper for long without its children being fully prepared. Many parents are busy with their jobs in the period of economic depression which implies that they don't have as much time for looking after their children. Government intervention would be a good solution to this problem.  

   It is my opinion that students are far less interested in politics than twenty years ago. In the past decade, an increasing number of students have not been concerned with public affairs neither at the domestic level nor the international level. They are busy with many other activities such as schools, social entertainments and sports. Nevertheless, I think students should have the freedom to decide how actively they will participate in politics.  

   My position is that raising fuel price is definitely not the best way to control the air pollution problem.  

   Although many young dreamers are adamant with their often unrealistic ideals, I prefer to pursue goals that engender actual results.  

   In spite of the obvious benefits of allocating the workloads evenly over the typical five working days, I prefer to work three-day a week even at the expense of fatigue.

##让步和结尾：
   当你写完第二个中间段时，全文字数应该在300字左右，这一数据是高老师通过撰写大量托福作文题目而得出的结论。这时，你最应该做的事情是用一到两句话结尾，复述你的主要观点，然后从开头段开始检查并修改你的语法错误和任何语句不通顺的地方。如果你的文章中出现两次或以上语句不通顺问题，你的作文分数最多定格在20分。  
   让步段的本质在于认可相反观点也有合理之处，但是，自己的观点更为正确，更应该被主张。如果你在写让步段时仅仅强调对方观点的正确性，无疑会混淆你的立场。  

   让步：Admittedly,Internet service has wide practical implications on our daily lives.The ability to access Internet has made many of our work and studies much more efficient.重申已方观点:Nevertheless,government should not only take the benefits of Internet access into access into consideration in regard to this issue.The public funding musht be allocated in accordance with the democratic and fair principle.  

   结尾段写作步骤可分为两步，第一步是复述己方观点，第二步是总结支撑己方观点的原因。  
   例题：Providing the Internet access is as important as other services, like building roads, so the government should provide it at no cost. (2015年4月13日大陆考题)  
已方观点：The government should not offer the service at the expense of the taxpayers.  
Reason1:First,Government subsidized free Internet is a breach of political principle.  
Reason2:The assumption that the Internet is as important as other infrastructure services is incorrect.  
结尾段：In conclusion,I think government should not assume the responsibility to offer free Internet service.(复述观点).The proposal not only is a breach of democratic and fair principle(总结理由1)，but mistakenly claims the Internet is as critical as other infrastructure(总结理由2).  

例题：People learn things better from those at their own level—such as fellow students or co-workers—than from those at a higher level,such as teachers or supervisors. (Official TOEFL Practice 4)  

已方观点：We should be learning from our teachers or supervisors who are apparently more knowledgeable and experienced.  
Reason1:Studying from your teachers if the best way to gain new knowledge.  
Reason2:People at your own level do not know much more than you.  
结尾段：In conclusion,learning from your supervisor and teachers is the best way to improve yourself.（复述观点）Not only can they pass on knowledge to you effectively(总结理由1)，but you can also benefit from their experiences。（总结理由2）
